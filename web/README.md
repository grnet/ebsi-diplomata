**Web service for EBSI-diplomas involved parties**

![Python >= 3.10](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-%3E%3D%203.10-blue.svg)

This is the Django application run by online parties involved in the EBSI-diplomas 
lifecycle. It is capable of issuing and verifying diplomas upon request from
a client, while also resolving DIDs which have been registered to the EBSI
ledger. It uses `ssi-lib`, which is currently a wrapper of
[`waltid-ssikit`](https://github.com/walt-id/waltid-ssikit).
